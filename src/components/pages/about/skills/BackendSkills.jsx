          I love building systems that are robust, scalable, secure, and
          efficient—always with clean architecture and developer-friendly APIs
          in mind. I truly enjoy working on:

        <p>
          When it comes to enterprise-grade applications or performance-critical
          services, .NET has been a solid choice in my toolkit for several
          years. I’ve used it to build scalable APIs, microservices, and
          background services, especially in environments where reliability and
          maintainability are paramount.

      <div className="text-left mx-4 pb-2">
        <h1 className="text-2xl text-left mb-2">Node.js</h1>
        <p>
          For fast, event-driven applications or real-time systems, Node.js is
          my go-to. I’ve leveraged its non-blocking architecture to build
          everything from RESTful APIs to websocket-based apps, and I appreciate
          how its lightweight nature accelerates development without sacrificing
          performance.

      <div className="text-left mx-4 pb-2">
        <h1 className="text-2xl text-left mb-2">Tailwind CSS</h1>
        <p>
          For now, I love using Tailwind CSS for styling, even though I've been
          using SCSS for a longer time (4 years). I'm really comfortable using
          it and I think it's a great tool.
