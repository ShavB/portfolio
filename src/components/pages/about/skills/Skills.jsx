            I started my career as a <strong> Software Engineer</strong> about 2
            years ago. I've tried some programming languages and tech stack,
            both Back-End, and Front-End.

            Even though the scope of web development is broad, I was very
            interested and focused on Front-End Development , Back-End
            Development and DevOps Engineer.
